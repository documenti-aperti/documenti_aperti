# Documenti Aperti
Documenti Aperti is a project born from the intership of three students of the Italian school ITIS Tullio Buzzi with the Insititute of Biometeorology of the Italian National Research Council (Firenze) with the objective to give people a mean to share and to find old texts that are at the limit of forgetfulness.
